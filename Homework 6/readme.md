Write programs to solve the following problems:

1.  Find out whether a matrix is a diagonal matrix.  (First check whether the matrix is a square matrix and then check whether the non diagonal elements are zeroes).
2.  Find out whether a matrix is a skew-symmetric matrix.  (First check whether the matrix is a square matrix and then check whether a_ij = - a_ji)
3.  Find an inverse of a matrix by finding its determinant, minor, cofactor and adjugate.

Try to reduce the number of iterations.
