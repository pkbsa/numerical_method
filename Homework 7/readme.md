Write programs to solve the following problems:

1.  Modify the Gauss's Elimination code provided in the lecture 7 to include part 1 of the row echelon procedure (to normalize the first non-zero coefficient to 1).
2.  Modify the code for Gauss-Jordan Elimination such that you can find the inverse of a matrix A.  A = [[3,0,2],[2,0,-2],[0,1,1]].

Try to reduce the number of iterations.
